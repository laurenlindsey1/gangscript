![](REALHOTGIRLSCRIPT.PNG)

## Introduction
Well, hello there 😈. This is RealHotGirlScript, a sexy, statically-typed, object-oriented, and esoteric programming language that truly puts the F-U in fun. RealHotGirlScript is meant to make you smile, laugh, and have a sense of confidence and joy as you create through computer programming. Its witty and hilarious syntax pulls from some of the sayings that the members of the team have each used as they programmed throughout the years together, as well as references to pop culture icons, such as Megan thee Stallion, Rickey Thompson, and Trevor Wallace. 

## Features
- optionals
- keywords for variables ending with z
- data structures similar to arrays, sets, and dictionaries
- closures that mimic Swift and Haskell styles
- object oriented programming
- switch statements
- ```.hotgirl``` file extension
- static typing

## Types
| JavaScript  | RealHotGirlScript |
| --- |---|
| string      | wordz | 
| number     | digitz (for integer values with paramterized length) or longz (for integers with unlimited length) |   
| const | stayz     | 
| bool | boolz      | 

## Variable Declaration and Assignment
| JavaScript  | RealHotGirlScript |
| --- |---|
| let x = 5;      | digitz x: 5!!! | 
| let y = “hello!”;     | wordz y: “hello!”!!! |   
| let z = 6.9; | longz z: 6.9!!!     | 
| const name = “real hot girl script”; | stayz name: “real hot girl script”!!!      | 

```
dictz stateCapitals: $"California" = "Sacramento", "Nevada" = "Carson City", "Oregon" = "Salem"#;

setz names: $“Shanaya”, “Keanna”, “Sage”, “Lauren”#;

## Arithmetic
- sum = 2 + 4
- difference = 4 - 2
- multiplication = 2 * 4
- integer division = 4 // 2
- float division = 4 / 2
- exponents = 2 ^ 4
- modulus = 4 % 2

## Control Flow
### If Statements
```
iHaveSomethingToSay🙅🏾‍♀️ x == 0 $
  andThemsTheFacts "trueShit"!!!
 # becauseWhyyy😼 $
  andThemsTheFacts "fraudulentAssBitch"!!!

```
### While Loops
``` 
wylin🤪 i < 10  $
  text = text + "The number is " + i!!!
  i++!!!
#
```
### For Loops
```
openHerUp🍑(digitz i: 0 🔥 i < 5 🔥 i++) $
  supLilBitch "The number is " + i!!!
